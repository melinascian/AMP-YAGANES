# Food web structure and species’ role in the sub-Antarctic Marine Protected Area Yaganes

The primary objective of this work was to build and characterise the network of trophic interactions of the Marine Protected Area Yaganes, specifically its pelagic realm, while achieving the highest taxonomic resolution possible. The method used to construct the food web was based on a bibliographic review, so the obtained product is not exhaustive, but represents a baseline and solid knowledge about potential predator-prey interactions and the importance of them for the integrity of the entire ecosystem. To accomplish the objective, we analysed the food web at both(a) the network-level, aiming to provide insights into the complexity and structure of the food web, and at (b) the species-level, to better understand the roles of individual species.

## Abstract 
The Marine Protected Area Yaganes (MPAY) was created in response to the significant deterioration of  ecosystems caused by  the environmental crisis  affecting our planet, with the aim of protecting key ocean habitats and species. Located at the southern tip of South America, MPAY is home to a wide variety of marine biodiversity and habitats,  making it of ​​special interest for the conservation of sub-Aantarctic environments. For the first time, we described the potential trophic interactions within the MPAY, with a focus on the pelagic realm. We applied both network-level and  species-level approaches to characterise the structure and complexity of the food web, aiming to understand trophic dynamics and the specific roles of certain species within it. In terms of complexity, the MPAY food web consists of at least 124 species with 656 predator-prey interactions, a density of interactions of 5.29 and a connectance of 0.04. Regarding its structure, approximately 71% of the species occupy intermediate trophic levels. The Keystone Species Index (KSI) highlighted the importance of some species such as the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii, euphausiids and myctophids, among others, to the structure of the food web. Identifying the relevance of these species lays the groundwork for the effective stewardship of the little-konwn MPAY, focusing on its conservation.
